## Install

```
$ npm install next-workbox-webpack-plugin
```

## Usage

```js
const nextWorkboxWebpackPlugin = require('next-workbox-webpack-plugin');

nextWorkboxWebpackPlugin({
  // must, you can get it at time time of Next.js compiling
  buildId: '6c071eb6-ab01-47bc-8074-71057afc1f64',
  // optional, next.js dist path as compiling. most of cases you don't need to fix it.
  distDir: '.next',
  // optional, which version of workbox will be used in between 'local' or 'cdn'. 'local'
  // option will help you use copy of workbox libs in localhost.
  importWorkboxFrom: 'local',
  // optional ,whether make a precache manifest of pages and chunks of Next.js app or not.
  precacheManifest: true,
  // optional, whether delete workbox path generated by the plugin.
  removeDir: true,
  // optional, you can use workbox-build options. except swDest because of output location is fixed in 'static/workbox'
  ...WorkboxBuildOptions,
});
```

## Usage in next.config.js

```
const NextWorkboxWebpackPlugin = require('next-workbox-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  webpack: (config, {isServer, dev, buildId, config: {distDir}}) => {
    if (!isServer && !dev) {
      config.plugins.push(new NextWorkboxWebpackPlugin({
        distDir,
        buildId
      }))
    }

    return config
  }
}
```

## How it works

For Next.js, It contains some of restrictions:

- Only works in `not dev mode` and on `the custom server` which means you can't test with `next` and `next start`
- You need customized server for serving service worker scripts and workbox libraries. For your convenience, [test server is in this package](https://github.com/ragingwind/next-workbox-webpack-plugin/blob/master/bin/next-workbox-start.js).
- All of files will be generated in `static/workbox` because of exporting. You might need to add the path to gitignore.
```

```
- You have to [add register service worker script](https://github.com/ragingwind/next-workbox-webpack-plugin/blob/master/examples/hello-pwa/pages/index.js) into part of your application
